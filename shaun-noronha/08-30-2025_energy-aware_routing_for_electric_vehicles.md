## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Monitoring: domain KPIs logged to Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana.
- Scalability: containerized services deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Processing: mix of batch ETL and low-latency inference.
- Security: API keys stored in Key Vault; TLS everywhere.
- Data sources: ride logs, external APIs, and survey data.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
def energy_cost(distance_km, efficiency=6.0):
    return distance_km/efficiency
```
