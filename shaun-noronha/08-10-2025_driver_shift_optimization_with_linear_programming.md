## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Driver Shift Optimization with Linear Programming** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Oistins (Christ Church) and Holetown (St. James).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
import pulp as pl
def optimize(drivers, demand_by_hour):
    x = pl.LpVariable.dicts('x',(drivers, range(24)), lowBound=0, upBound=1, cat='Binary')
    prob = pl.LpProblem('Roster', pl.LpMaximize)
    prob += pl.lpSum(x[d][h] for d in drivers for h in range(24))
    for h in range(24):
        prob += pl.lpSum(x[d][h] for d in drivers) >= demand_by_hour[h]
    for d in drivers:
        prob += pl.lpSum(x[d][h] for h in range(24)) <= 8
    prob.solve(); return prob.status
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Driver Shift Optimization with Linear Programming** to production serving riders between Bathsheba (St. Joseph) and Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal.  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.
