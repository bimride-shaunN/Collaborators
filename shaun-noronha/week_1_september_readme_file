## 🚗 2025-09-01 – Weather-Aware Demand Pricing  
**Date:** 2025-09-01  
**Author:** Shaun Noronha  

### 🚀 Introduction  
Today’s work focused on integrating **weather-aware demand pricing**. Barbados experiences sudden showers, especially around Bridgetown, which directly impacts ride requests. By dynamically adjusting prices when rainfall or storms occur, we help ensure driver availability while avoiding passenger drop-offs.  

### ⚙️ Architecture Overview  
```
[Weather API] ---> [Pricing Engine] ---> [Bimride App] ---> [Users]
       |                    |
 [Forecast Data]      [Surge Multiplier]
```
The Weather API continuously feeds forecast data into the pricing engine, which then calculates surge multipliers in real-time.  

### 🧠 Algorithms Used  
```python
def weather_surge(base_fare, rain_prob, wind_speed):
    surge = 1
    if rain_prob > 0.6:
        surge += 0.3
    if wind_speed > 25:
        surge += 0.2
    return round(base_fare * surge, 2)
```

### 🔁 MLOps Workflow Example  
```yaml
name: weather-pricing-deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
