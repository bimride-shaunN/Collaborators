## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Real-Time Fraud Detection for Bimride Payments** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal and Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
from collections import deque
def rolling_stats(window=300):
    q, s, sq = deque(), 0.0, 0.0
    def update(x):
        nonlocal s, sq
        q.append(x); s += x; sq += x*x
        if len(q) > window:
            old = q.popleft(); s -= old; sq -= old*old
        n = len(q); mean = s/n; var = max(sq/n - mean*mean, 1e-6)
        return (x-mean)/(var**0.5)
    return update

z = rolling_stats(500)
flag = lambda amt: abs(z(amt)) > 4.2
```

## üéØ KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- <0.1% false positives
- detect within 2s
- chargeback rate < 0.3%

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions ‚Üí add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute ‚Üí enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns ‚Üí pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.
