## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Monitoring: domain KPIs logged to Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana.
- Processing: mix of batch ETL and low-latency inference.
- Scalability: containerized services deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Security: API keys stored in Key Vault; TLS everywhere.
- Data sources: ride logs, external APIs, and survey data.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, prev, data):
        self.prev=prev; self.data=data
```
