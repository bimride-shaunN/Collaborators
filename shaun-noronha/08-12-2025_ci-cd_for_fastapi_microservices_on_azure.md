## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **CI/CD for FastAPI Microservices on Azure** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal and Oistins (Christ Church).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.
- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app=FastAPI()
@app.get('/healthz')
def health(): return {'ok':True}
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **CI/CD for FastAPI Microservices on Azure** to production serving riders between Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal and Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI).  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.

## üîå Public API Sketch (OpenAPI)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: CI/CD for FastAPI Microservices on Azure API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/ci-cd-for-fastapi-microservices-on-azure/status:
    get:
      responses: {'200': {'description': 'ok'}}
```

---

## üéØ KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- p95 latency < 200ms
- zero-downtime deploys
- rollbacks < 5min

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions ‚Üí add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute ‚Üí enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns ‚Üí pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.
