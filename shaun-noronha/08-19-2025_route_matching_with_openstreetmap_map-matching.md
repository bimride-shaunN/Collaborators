## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Route Matching with OpenStreetMap Map-Matching** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal and Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
# HMM map-matching pseudocode: states = candidate road segments; emissions = GPS distance; transitions = turn penalties
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Route Matching with OpenStreetMap Map-Matching** to production serving riders between Bathsheba (St. Joseph) and Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal.  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.

## üîå Public API Sketch (OpenAPI)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Route Matching with OpenStreetMap Map-Matching API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/route-matching-with-openstreetmap-map-matching/status:
    get:
      responses: {'200': {'description': 'ok'}}
```

## üéØ KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- ETA error -12%
- trace snap rate > 98%
- gps jitter tolerance +30%

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions ‚Üí add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute ‚Üí enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns ‚Üí pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This artifact documents substantive progress on **Route Matching with OpenStreetMap Map-Matching**. The implementation is reproducible,
secure by default, and measured against clear KPIs suitable for nonprofit audits in Barbados.
