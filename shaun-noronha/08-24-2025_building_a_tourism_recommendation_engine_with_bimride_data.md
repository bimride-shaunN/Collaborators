## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Security: API keys stored in Key Vault; TLS everywhere.
- Processing: mix of batch ETL and low-latency inference.
- Data sources: ride logs, external APIs, and survey data.
- Scalability: containerized services deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Monitoring: domain KPIs logged to Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
import numpy as np
def recommend(user_vec, item_mat):
    scores = item_mat @ user_vec
    return np.argsort(-scores)[:5]
```
