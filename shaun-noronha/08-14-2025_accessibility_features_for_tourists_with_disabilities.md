## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Accessibility Features for Tourists with Disabilities** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include St. Lawrence Gap and Holetown (St. James).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
def filter_accessible(vehicles):
    return [v for v in vehicles if v.get('wheelchair_access',False)]
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Accessibility Features for Tourists with Disabilities** to production serving riders between Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal and Holetown (St. James).  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.
