## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Geofencing and Zone Pricing Strategy** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Bathsheba (St. Joseph) and Speightstown (St. Peter).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon
zones = {'BGI': Polygon([(-59.492,13.067),(-59.473,13.067),(-59.473,13.086),(-59.492,13.086)])}
def zone_of(lon, lat):
    p = Point(lon, lat)
    return next((k for k,v in zones.items() if v.contains(p)), None)
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Geofencing and Zone Pricing Strategy** to production serving riders between Bathsheba (St. Joseph) and St. Lawrence Gap.  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.

## üìê Data Model (SQL)

```sql
-- Minimal schema for geofencing-and-zone-pricing-strategy
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_geofencing_and_zone_pricing_strategy (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  happened_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  metric TEXT NOT NULL,
  value DOUBLE PRECISION,
  notes TEXT
);
```

## üîå Public API Sketch (OpenAPI)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Geofencing and Zone Pricing Strategy API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/geofencing-and-zone-pricing-strategy/status:
    get:
      responses: {'200': {'description': 'ok'}}
```

## üéØ KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- pickup ETA -10%
- zone leakage < 3%
- surge accuracy +8%

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions ‚Üí add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute ‚Üí enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns ‚Üí pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This artifact documents substantive progress on **Geofencing and Zone Pricing Strategy**. The implementation is reproducible,
secure by default, and measured against clear KPIs suitable for nonprofit audits in Barbados.
