## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Telemetry Pipeline with Kafka and Apache Iceberg** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Speightstown (St. Peter) and Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json
def emit(producer, topic, event): producer.send(topic, json.dumps(event).encode())
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Telemetry Pipeline with Kafka and Apache Iceberg** to production serving riders between Speightstown (St. Peter) and St. Lawrence Gap.  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.

## üìê Data Model (SQL)

```sql
-- Minimal schema for telemetry-pipeline-with-kafka-and-apache-iceberg
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_telemetry_pipeline_with_kafka_and_apache_iceberg (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  happened_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  metric TEXT NOT NULL,
  value DOUBLE PRECISION,
  notes TEXT
);
```

## üîå Public API Sketch (OpenAPI)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Telemetry Pipeline with Kafka and Apache Iceberg API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/telemetry-pipeline-with-kafka-and-apache-iceberg/status:
    get:
      responses: {'200': {'description': 'ok'}}
```

---

## üéØ KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- end-to-end lag < 5s
- data loss 0
- backfill speed > 50MB/s

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions ‚Üí add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute ‚Üí enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns ‚Üí pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This artifact documents substantive progress on **Telemetry Pipeline with Kafka and Apache Iceberg**. The implementation is reproducible,
secure by default, and measured against clear KPIs suitable for nonprofit audits in Barbados.
