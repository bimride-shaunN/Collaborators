## Introduction

In this technical document, we explore the application of **How DSA Concepts Can Optimize Bimride's Route Planning** to improve Bimride’s intelligent transportation system in Barbados. This deep dive addresses how cutting-edge concepts in AI, MLOps, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) can create a smarter, more reliable taxi network.

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular design:

- User App Request → API Gateway  
- API Gateway → Prediction Service (FastAPI)  
- Prediction Service ↔ ML Model Container (Docker)  
- Prediction Service ↔ Feature Store (Tecton)  
- ML Model ↔ Model Registry (MLflow)  
- ML Model → Monitoring Tools (Prometheus/Grafana)

## Algorithms Used

### Example: Dijkstra’s Algorithm for Shortest Path

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances
```

## Application to Bimride

- **Graph Nodes**: Pickup & drop-off locations  
- **Edge Weights**: Travel time based on traffic, road length, and conditions  
- **Usage**: Compute most efficient driver routes across Barbados dynamically

## Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Bimride wants to reduce fuel costs and delays by finding the shortest and fastest routes in high-density areas like Bridgetown.

**Solution**: Apply Dijkstra’s algorithm using updated road graph data every 5 minutes, ensuring real-time dynamic routing based on evolving traffic conditions.
