## 🚀 Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Edge Analytics with Android Sensors for Safety** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include St. Lawrence Gap and St. Lawrence Gap.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) → feature store.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

```python
def harsh_brake(ax, thr=-3.2):
    return [i for i,a in enumerate(ax) if a<thr]
```

## 🔍 Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Edge Analytics with Android Sensors for Safety** to production serving riders between Bridgetown Harbour & Cruise Terminal and Bathsheba (St. Joseph).  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.

## 📐 Data Model (SQL)

```sql
-- Minimal schema for edge-analytics-with-android-sensors-for-safety
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_edge_analytics_with_android_sensors_for_safety (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  happened_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  metric TEXT NOT NULL,
  value DOUBLE PRECISION,
  notes TEXT
);
```

## 🔌 Public API Sketch (OpenAPI)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Edge Analytics with Android Sensors for Safety API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/edge-analytics-with-android-sensors-for-safety/status:
    get:
      responses: {'200': {'description': 'ok'}}
```

---

## 🎯 KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- on-device inference < 50ms
- battery impact < 3%
- recall > 0.9

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions → add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute → enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns → pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.

## ✅ Conclusion

This artifact documents substantive progress on **Edge Analytics with Android Sensors for Safety**. The implementation is reproducible,
secure by default, and measured against clear KPIs suitable for nonprofit audits in Barbados.
