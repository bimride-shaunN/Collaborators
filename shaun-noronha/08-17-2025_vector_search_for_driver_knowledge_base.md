## 🚀 Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Vector Search for Driver Knowledge Base** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Speightstown (St. Peter) and Harrison’s Cave.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) → feature store.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
model=SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
def top(query, docs, k=3):
    qv = model.encode([query], convert_to_tensor=True)
    dv = model.encode(docs, convert_to_tensor=True)
    scores = util.cos_sim(qv, dv)[0].tolist()
    order = sorted(range(len(docs)), key=lambda i: -scores[i])[:k]
    return [(docs[i], scores[i]) for i in order]
```

## 🔍 Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Vector Search for Driver Knowledge Base** to production serving riders between Holetown (St. James) and Speightstown (St. Peter).  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.

## 📐 Data Model (SQL)

```sql
-- Minimal schema for vector-search-for-driver-knowledge-base
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_vector_search_for_driver_knowledge_base (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  happened_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  metric TEXT NOT NULL,
  value DOUBLE PRECISION,
  notes TEXT
);
```

## 🔌 Public API Sketch (OpenAPI)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Vector Search for Driver Knowledge Base API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/vector-search-for-driver-knowledge-base/status:
    get:
      responses: {'200': {'description': 'ok'}}
```

---

## 🎯 KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- top-5 MRR > 0.6
- query latency < 100ms
- index freshness < 1h

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions → add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute → enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns → pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.

## ✅ Conclusion

This artifact documents substantive progress on **Vector Search for Driver Knowledge Base**. The implementation is reproducible,
secure by default, and measured against clear KPIs suitable for nonprofit audits in Barbados.
