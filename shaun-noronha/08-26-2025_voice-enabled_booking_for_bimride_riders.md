## üöÄ Introduction

Hands-free booking improves accessibility for seniors and helps tourists who are unfamiliar with the app. We combine VAD, ASR, and intent parsing to create reliable **voice-enabled booking**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview


```
[Microphone] -> [VAD] -> [ASR] -> [Intent Parser] -> [Booking API]
                      ^                          \-> [Disambiguation prompts]
               [Noise Suppression]
```
Highlights:
- Offline fallback ASR keeps basic functionality during network outages.
- Domain-specific grammar reduces ambiguity for places like Oistins and Bathsheba.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
# Simple voice intent extraction (toy example)
def parse_intent(text):
    text = text.lower()
    if "book" in text and "to" in text:
        # naive parse: everything after 'to' is destination
        dest = text.split("to",1)[1].strip()
        return {"intent":"book_ride","destination":dest}
    return {"intent":"unknown"}

print(parse_intent("Please book a ride to Oistins Fish Fry"))
```

## üîÅ MLOps Workflow Example

```yaml
name: voice-booking-ci
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'voice/**'
      - 'nlu/**'
jobs:
  tests-and-export:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install
        run: pip install -r voice/requirements.txt
      - name: Unit tests (NLU + VAD)
        run: pytest -q
      - name: Evaluate ASR accuracy (WER)
        run: python voice/eval_asr.py --dataset data/barbados_accent.json
      - name: Export intents model
        run: python nlu/export.py --format onnx
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

A rider in **Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI)** says, ‚ÄúBook a ride to Miami Beach at 7 pm.‚Äù The system confirms the pickup time and destination via voice and posts the booking.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Monitoring: domain KPIs logged to Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana.
- Data sources: ride logs, external APIs, and survey data.
- Scalability: containerized services deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Security: API keys stored in Key Vault; TLS everywhere.
- Processing: mix of batch ETL and low-latency inference.

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
def transcribe(path):
    r=sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.AudioFile(path) as src: audio=r.record(src)
    return r.recognize_google(audio)
```
