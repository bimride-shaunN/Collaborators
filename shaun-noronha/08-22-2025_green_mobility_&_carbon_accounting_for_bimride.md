## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Green Mobility & Carbon Accounting for Bimride** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Oistins (Christ Church) and Holetown (St. James).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
def grams_co2_km(fuel_type):
    return {'ice':192, 'hybrid':120, 'ev':0}.get(fuel_type, 192)
```
