## üöÄ Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Demand Forecasting with XGBoost in Barbados** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Bathsheba (St. Joseph) and Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) ‚Üí feature store.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
import xgboost as xgb, pandas as pd
def train(df):
    X = df[['parish_id','hour','temp_c','holiday','cruise_ships']]
    y = df['rides']
    model = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=400, max_depth=7, subsample=0.8, learning_rate=0.05)
    model.fit(X,y)
    return model
```

## üîç Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Demand Forecasting with XGBoost in Barbados** to production serving riders between Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI) and Speightstown (St. Peter).  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.
