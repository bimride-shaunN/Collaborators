## 🚀 Introduction

In this technical document, we implement **Offline-First Mobile Architecture** for Bimride in Barbados.
This write-up is intended as a progress artifact for nonprofit auditing and background checks,
covering architecture, algorithms, CI/CD and KPIs. Reference areas include Oistins (Christ Church) and Bathsheba (St. Joseph).

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

- Service boundaries: `pricing`, `safety`, `routing`, `support`, `compliance`.
- Event ingestion via Kafka (rides, payments, app telemetry) → feature store.
- Batch processing in Spark for daily aggregates; Flink for streaming features.
- Authentication with OAuth2; RBAC for ops dashboards; secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Canary releases using workload identity; blue/green for risky changes.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

```python
import time, collections
q = collections.deque()
def enqueue(req): q.append(req)
def flush(send):
    while q:
        if send(q[0]): q.popleft()
        else: time.sleep(2); break
```

## 🔍 Real-World Scenario

**Use Case**: Deploy **Offline-First Mobile Architecture** to production serving riders between Holetown (St. James) and Harrison’s Cave.  
**Solution**: Roll out to 10% traffic for 48 hours, evaluate KPIs, then ramp to 50% if targets hold.

## 📐 Data Model (SQL)

```sql
-- Minimal schema for offline-first-mobile-architecture
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_offline_first_mobile_architecture (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  happened_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  entity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  metric TEXT NOT NULL,
  value DOUBLE PRECISION,
  notes TEXT
);
```

## 🔌 Public API Sketch (OpenAPI)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Offline-First Mobile Architecture API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/offline-first-mobile-architecture/status:
    get:
      responses: {'200': {'description': 'ok'}}
```

---

## 🎯 KPIs / Acceptance Criteria

- booking success offline > 95%
- sync conflicts < 0.5%
- queue drain < 10s

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- Data drift causing degraded predictions → add nightly drift report with Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests.  
- Cost spikes on storage/compute → enable object lifecycle and spot instances for batch jobs.  
- Privacy concerns → pseudonymize rider IDs and enforce retention windows.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This artifact documents substantive progress on **Offline-First Mobile Architecture**. The implementation is reproducible,
secure by default, and measured against clear KPIs suitable for nonprofit audits in Barbados.
