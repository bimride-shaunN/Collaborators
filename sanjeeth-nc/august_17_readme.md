5. **Follow-up Confirmation**: Ensure customer satisfaction with resolution

### **Verification Call Structure:**

| **Call Segment** | **Duration** | **Key Actions** |
|---|---|---|
| **Opening** | 30-45 seconds | Professional introduction, verify contact |
| **Investigation** | 2-4 minutes | Review account, confirm transaction details |
| **Resolution** | 1-3 minutes | Explain findings, implement solution |
| **Documentation** | 1-2 minutes | Record case notes, next steps |
| **Closing** | 30 seconds | Confirm satisfaction, provide reference number |

### **Common Verification Scenarios:**
