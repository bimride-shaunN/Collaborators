🚖 Day 5 — Dynamic Pricing & Revenue Optimization Engine for Bimride
🎯 Objective
Design a dynamic pricing engine for a ride-hailing platform that:

Calculates base fare and surge multipliers in real time
Adjusts for time of day, demand/supply ratio, and traffic conditions
Integrates Python analytics loop to optimize future pricing strategies
Targets profit maximization without harming rider retention


🏗️ Pricing Model Components
1) Base Fare
Calculated using:

Pickup fee (fixed)
Distance fare: per km/mile rate
Time fare: per minute rate
Minimum fare guarantee

Formula:
fare = pickup_fee + (distance_km * per_km_rate) + (duration_min * per_min_rate)
fare = max(fare, minimum_fare)

2) Surge Multiplier
Triggered when demand > supply in a given geo-zone.
Surge Calculation:
demand_supply_ratio = active_ride_requests / available_drivers
if ratio > threshold:
    surge_multiplier = 1 + ((ratio - threshold) * surge_rate)
else:
    surge_multiplier = 1

Threshold example: 1.2
Surge rate example: 0.5 → ratio of 2.0 becomes surge = 1 + ((2.0 - 1.2) * 0.5) = 1.4x


3) Special Adjustments

Traffic delay adjustment: Higher per-minute rate in congested areas
Time-based multipliers: Peak hours (morning/evening commute)
Event-based boosts: Concerts, holidays, sports events
Promotions & Discounts: Rider loyalty program integration

⚡ Real-Time Flow
[Rider requests ride]
       ↓
[Match service queries pricing API with zone_id]
       ↓
[Pricing service fetches base rates + surge rules]
       ↓
[Surge multiplier computed from current demand/supply stats in Redis]
       ↓
[Final fare estimate sent to rider before trip confirmation]

📊 Python Analytics Loop for Optimization
pythonimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Load historical trip data
df = pd.read_csv("trip_history.csv")

# Calculate demand/supply ratio by time and zone
demand_supply = df.groupby(["zone_id", "hour"]).apply(
    lambda g: len(g[g['status'] == 'requested']) / max(len(g[g['status'] == 'available_driver']), 1)
)

# Identify missed requests (no driver assigned within SLA)
missed_ratio = df[df['status'] == 'missed'].groupby('zone_id').size() / df.groupby('zone_id').size()

# Adjust surge thresholds dynamically
new_thresholds = {}
for zone, ratio in missed_ratio.items():
    if ratio > 0.15:  # more than 15% missed
        new_thresholds[zone] = max(1.0, demand_supply.loc[zone].mean() - 0.2)
    else:
        new_thresholds[zone] = 1.2

print("Updated surge thresholds:", new_thresholds)

📈 Performance Targets
MetricTargetFare estimate latency< 150 msSurge recalculationEvery 30–60sMissed ride rate< 10%Revenue improvement+10–15% after 1 monthRider drop-off rateNo more than +2%

🔐 Security & Fairness

Transparent Pricing: Riders see the multiplier before confirming.
Driver Incentives: Surge directly affects driver earnings.
Anti-manipulation: Prevent artificial demand spikes from triggering surge.
Audit Logging: Store all fare calculations for disputes & compliance.


🌍 Real-World Examples

Uber uses machine learning models to adjust surge dynamically per geo-tile every few minutes.
Lyft applies "Prime Time" surges but caps multipliers to avoid PR backlash.
Bolt applies more gradual fare adjustments to prevent rider churn.
