# BimRide Support Workflow Escalations And KPIs

Purpose: Show how a ticket moves from intake to resolution, when to escalate, and how we measure our work.

## Ticket flow from start to finish
1. Intake  
   * Read the message or call notes  
   * Tag the ticket type and city  
2. Verify identity  
   * Confirm phone or email  
   * Match the person to the profile  
3. Diagnose  
   * Open the right page in the panel  
   * Check timeline, payments, or live status  
4. Plan  
   * Pick the smallest fix that solves the request  
   * Write a short plan in the ticket  
5. Implement  
   * Make the change in the panel  
   * Add a short reason before saving  
6. Confirm  
   * Tell the customer what changed  
   * Ask if they need anything else  
7. Close  
   * Summarize the fix  
   * Link any receipts or invoices

## When to escalate
Escalate right away if any of these are true  
* Safety or threat is reported  
* Money moved in a way that looks wrong and you are not sure why  
* The ride record has missing steps in the timeline  
* The panel will not save your change and shows an error

How to escalate  
* Add a clear one line summary at the top of the ticket  
* Tag the correct team such as safety or finance  
* Paste the link to the profile or trip you opened

## Writing clear updates
* Use simple sentences  
* One topic per paragraph  
* State what you did and why  
* If a fix needs time give a time range and the next update time

## KPIs we watch
* First response time  
* First contact resolution  
* Customer satisfaction score  
* Ticket reopen rate  
* Number of cases per person per day

## Daily checklist
* Clear priority queue first  
* Answer anyone still waiting for a promised update  
* Close tickets that have a confirmed fix  
* Note any repeated issues for the product team

## Weekly review
* Look at top reasons for contact  
* Share three wins and three ideas to improve  
* Update saved replies that felt confusing  
* Plan a short practice on a tricky topic next week
