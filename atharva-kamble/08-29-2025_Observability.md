## Overview

BimRide operates in a real-time environment where seconds matter - riders expect immediate ride matching, drivers need instant trip notifications, and payments must process reliably. Comprehensive observability enables proactive issue detection, while well-defined SLOs ensure customer experience remains consistent. Effective incident response minimizes impact when issues occur.

## Challenges Faced by BimRide

### Operational Blindness
- **Complex microservices architecture** makes it difficult to understand system behavior
- **Distributed tracing gaps** obscure root causes of performance issues
- **Metric fragmentation** across different monitoring tools and teams
- **Alert fatigue** from too many false positives and low-priority notifications

### Customer Impact Visibility
- **Delayed incident detection** leads to prolonged user experience degradation
- **Unclear blast radius** makes it hard to assess how many users are affected
- **Missing business metrics** prevent understanding of revenue impact
- **Poor correlation** between technical metrics and customer satisfaction

### Incident Response Inefficiencies
- **Unclear escalation paths** delay resolution during critical outages
- **Missing runbooks** force engineers to debug from scratch
- **Inadequate postmortems** prevent learning from past incidents
- **Communication gaps** between engineering teams and customer support

## Observability Foundation

### Three Pillars of Observability

**Metrics**: Numerical measurements over time
- Request rates, error rates, latency percentiles
- Business metrics: successful rides, payment failures
- Infrastructure metrics: CPU, memory, disk usage
- Custom metrics: driver utilization, surge multipliers

**Logs**: Discrete event records with context
- Structured logging with consistent formats
- Request IDs for correlation across services
- Error logs with stack traces and context
- Audit logs for compliance and security

**Traces**: Request flow through distributed systems
- End-to-end latency breakdown across services
- Service dependency mapping
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error propagation analysis

### Golden Signals for BimRide

**Latency**: How fast the system responds
- Ride matching time: < 30 seconds target
- Payment processing: < 5 seconds target
- Driver ETA updates: < 2 seconds target
- App loading time: < 3 seconds target

**Traffic**: Demand on the system
- Ride requests per minute
- Active drivers online
- Payment transactions per hour
- API calls per endpoint

**Errors**: Rate of failed requests
- Failed ride matches
- Payment processing failures
- App crashes and timeouts
- HTTP 4xx/5xx error rates

**Saturation**: How utilized system resources are
- Database connection pool usage
- Message queue depth
- CPU and memory utilization
- Network bandwidth consumption

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Customer-Facing SLOs

**Ride Matching Service**
- Availability: 99.9% (8.7 hours downtime per year)
- Latency: 95% of matches completed within 30 seconds
- Success Rate: 98% of valid requests result in driver assignment

**Payment Processing**
- Availability: 99.95% (4.3 hours downtime per year)
- Latency: 99% of payments processed within 5 seconds
- Success Rate: 99.5% of valid payment attempts succeed

**Driver Location Updates**
- Freshness: 95% of location updates received within 10 seconds
- Accuracy: 99% of locations within 50 meters of actual position
- Availability: 99.8% uptime for location tracking service

### Internal SLOs

**API Gateway**
- Latency: P99 response time < 500ms
- Throughput: Handle 50K requests per second
- Error Rate: < 0.1% of requests fail due to gateway issues

**Database Performance**
- Query Latency: P95 < 100ms for read queries
- Connection Pool: < 80% utilization during peak hours
- Replication Lag: < 1 second between primary and replica

## Alert Thresholds and Escalation

### Alert Severity Levels

**Critical (P0)**
- Complete service outage affecting all users
- Payment processing completely down
- Security incidents with data exposure
- Immediate escalation to on-call engineer and incident commander

**High (P1)**
- Significant user impact (>10% of requests failing)
- Single region outage
- SLO burn rate indicates monthly budget exhaustion in <2 hours
- Escalation within 15 minutes

**Medium (P2)**
- Degraded performance but service functional
- Error rates elevated but below critical thresholds
- Capacity constraints approaching limits
- Escalation within 1 hour

**Low (P3)**
- Performance slightly outside normal range
- Non-critical system warnings
- Monitoring system issues
- Escalation during business hours

### Alerting Best Practices
- **Symptom-based alerts** rather than cause-based
- **Multi-window alerting** to reduce flapping
- **Alert grouping** to prevent notification storms
- **Escalation policies** with automatic handoff

## Incident Response Framework

### Incident Response Roles

**Incident Commander**
- Coordinates overall response effort
- Makes decisions about escalation and communication
- Ensures proper documentation and follow-up
- Authority to mobilize resources as needed

**Technical Lead**
- Leads debugging and resolution efforts
- Coordinates with other engineers
- Implements fixes and verifies resolution
- Reports status to incident commander

**Communications Lead**
- Updates stakeholders and customers
- Manages social media and support channel responses
- Coordinates with customer support teams
- Maintains incident timeline and status page

### Response Process

**Detection and Triage (0-5 minutes)**
- Automated alerting triggers incident response
- On-call engineer confirms issue severity
- Incident commander assigned for P0/P1 incidents
- Initial impact assessment and stakeholder notification

**Investigation and Mitigation (5-30 minutes)**
- Technical teams begin root cause analysis
- Immediate mitigation steps implemented
- Customer communication initiated
- Additional resources mobilized if needed

**Resolution and Recovery (30+ minutes)**
- Permanent fix implemented and tested
- System monitoring for secondary effects
- Customer notification of resolution
- Post-incident review scheduled
