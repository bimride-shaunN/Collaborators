# BimRide Admin Panel Overview And Access

Purpose: Give a clear overview of what the admin panel does, who should use it, and how to work safely and confidently.

## What the admin panel is
The admin panel is a secure website for BimRide staff. It helps you find rider and driver information, look up trips, fix simple problems, and keep a record of what was done.

## Who uses it
* Support team for customer help  
* Dispatch team for live ride checks  
* Finance team for refunds and invoices  
* Operations leads for quality reviews

## How to sign in
* Use company email and password  
* Complete the two step code on your phone  
* Sessions expire after a short time for safety

## Roles and permissions
Each user has a role such as admin, support, finance, or dispatcher. Your role decides what you can view and what you can change. If you cannot see a control you probably do not have that permission. Ask a lead if you need temporary access for a case.

## Main areas in the panel
* Search bar for riders, drivers, and trips  
* User profiles with contact info, payment methods, and wallet  
* Trip pages with full timelines and receipts  
* Payments and refunds section for finance tasks  
* Settings and feature flags for admins only  
* Audit log that shows who did what and when

## Finding the right record
* Search by phone, email, or trip id  
* Filter by city and date if you see many results  
* Open the timeline on the trip page to see each step from request to receipt

## Safety rules
* Only change what the ticket requires  
* Write a short reason before you save a change  
* Never copy personal data outside approved tools  
* Log out if you step away from your device

## Common actions you will use
* Resend a receipt to the rider email  
* Add a small fare adjustment with a note  
* Help a rider update a payment method  
* View driver documents and account status  
* Check live ride status and share an arrival update

## Helpful habits
* Confirm identity before you discuss account details  
* Repeat back the request so the customer knows you heard them  
* Keep messages short and polite  
* Close the ticket with a clear summary

Outcome  
You can sign in, find the right record, make safe changes, and leave a clean audit trail that explains your work.
