# Geofence Service and Zone Management

üè∑Ô∏è **Label:** GEOFENCE_SERVICE_AND_ZONE_MANAGEMENT  

---

## üéØ Purpose
Design and maintain geofences for **BimRide** operations. Geofences define zones for pricing, compliance, promotions, and surge detection. The system must support millions of point-in-polygon checks daily with low latency while remaining flexible for regulatory and business rules.

---

## üß© Zone Data Model

### Zone Types
- **Operational Zones**  
  Define where riders can request trips and drivers can accept them.
- **Surge Pricing Zones**  
  Dynamic boundaries updated in near real time to reflect demand-supply imbalance.
- **Regulatory Zones**  
  Fixed areas like airports or city centers with special rules.
- **Promotional Zones**  
  Marketing-driven, e.g., discounted fares for events.

### Schema Example
```sql
CREATE TABLE geofences (
    zone_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('operational', 'surge', 'regulatory', 'promo')),
    polygon GEOMETRY(POLYGON, 4326),
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## üì¶ Polygon Storage
- **Database:** PostGIS or similar for geospatial operations.
- **Serialization:** Store polygons in WKB (Well-Known Binary) or GeoJSON for API use.
- **Simplification:** Use Douglas-Peucker algorithm to reduce polygon complexity for faster queries.

## üßÆ Point-in-Polygon Checks

### Algorithms
- **Ray Casting:** Lightweight, works for convex and concave polygons.
- **Winding Number:** More precise, especially for polygons with holes.

### Optimizations
- Precompute bounding boxes for polygons to short-circuit checks.
- Use R-tree indexes for spatial queries.
- Cache common lookups (airport zones, stadiums).

```python
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon

zone_polygon = Polygon([(-59.6, 13.0), (-59.4, 13.0), (-59.4, 13.2), (-59.6, 13.2)])
pickup = Point(-59.5, 13.1)

if zone_polygon.contains(pickup):
    print("Pickup inside zone")
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Surge Zones vs Regulatory Zones

### Surge Zones
- Generated dynamically by demand forecasting service.
- Require frequent cache refresh (30s‚Äì1m).
- Stored in Redis with TTL for fast access.

### Regulatory Zones
- Static or rarely updated.
- Require strict version control and audit logs.
- Must enforce overrides (e.g., airport pickup surcharge).

## üöÄ Cache Strategy

### Layers

#### In-Memory (L1)
Hot cache on geofence service nodes for sub-ms lookups.

#### Distributed Cache (L2)
Redis or Memcached storing precomputed zone mappings.

#### Database (L3)
PostGIS backend for less frequent queries or bulk updates.

### Key Design
```
zone:{zone_id} ‚Üí polygon definition
point:{lat}:{lng} ‚Üí resolved zone ID (short TTL)
```

### Stampede Control
- Use request coalescing so multiple lookups for the same point share one DB call.
- Async refresh to prevent cold-start storms.

## üìä Outcomes
- **Zone Data Model:** Supports multiple types with metadata.
- **Polygon Storage:** Efficient storage with geospatial indexing.
- **Point-in-Polygon Checks:** Optimized with bounding boxes and caching.
- **Surge vs Regulatory Zones:** Clear separation of dynamic vs static policies.
- **Cache Strategy:** Three-tier system for latency and reliability.

## üîó Strategic Impact
- **Rider Experience:** Accurate enforcement of pricing and availability.
- **Driver Fairness:** Consistent rules across high-demand zones.
- **Compliance:** Satisfies local regulations without manual intervention.
- **Scalability:** Supports millions of requests per second with caching.
