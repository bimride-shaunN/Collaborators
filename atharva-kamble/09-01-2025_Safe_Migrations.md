## Overview

BimRide's database contains critical business data - active rides, driver locations, payment information, and user accounts. Database schema changes must be executed without service interruption while maintaining data integrity. A well-designed migration strategy enables continuous deployment and rapid rollbacks when issues arise.

## Challenges Faced by BimRide

### Zero-Downtime Requirements
- **24/7 operations** require database changes without service interruption
- **Real-time location tracking** cannot tolerate connection drops during migrations
- **Payment processing** must continue uninterrupted during schema updates
- **Global deployment** across multiple time zones complicates maintenance windows

### Data Integrity Risks
- **Large table migrations** on ride history or location data can take hours
- **Foreign key constraints** prevent simple column drops or table changes
- **Data corruption** risks during failed migrations affect business operations
- **Inconsistent state** between application versions and database schema

### Deployment Complexity
- **Multiple application instances** may use different schema versions simultaneously
- **Blue-green deployments** require schema compatibility across versions
- **Rollback scenarios** need quick recovery without data loss
- **Testing challenges** in production-like environments with realistic data volumes

### Performance Impact
- **Long-running migrations** can cause table locks and query delays
- **Index rebuilding** affects query performance during peak hours
- **Replication lag** increases during large data migrations
- **Storage overhead** from temporary columns and tables during transitions

## Online Schema Changes Strategy

### Non-Blocking Operations
- Add new columns with default values
- Create new indexes concurrently
- Add new tables without foreign key constraints initially
- Modify non-critical table metadata and comments

### Blocking Operations to Avoid
- Drop columns or tables during business hours
- Modify column types that require table rewrites
- Add foreign key constraints to existing large tables
- Rename columns that application code depends on

### Lock-Free Techniques
- Use database-specific online DDL capabilities
- Implement application-level schema versioning
- Create shadow tables for major restructuring
- Utilize read replicas for data validation

### Timing Considerations
- Schedule blocking operations during low-traffic periods
- Monitor active connections and transaction duration
- Implement migration timeouts to prevent indefinite locks
- Coordinate with planned maintenance windows

---

## Expand and Contract Pattern

### Expansion Phase
- Add new schema elements alongside existing ones
- Deploy application code that can handle both old and new schemas
- Begin writing to new schema elements while maintaining old ones
- Validate data consistency between old and new structures

### Migration Phase
- Backfill historical data to new schema elements
- Route read traffic to new schema elements gradually
- Monitor performance and data consistency
- Maintain dual-write capability for rollback scenarios

### Contraction Phase
- Stop writing to old schema elements
- Deploy application code that only uses new schema
- Remove old schema elements after verification period
- Clean up migration artifacts and temporary structures

### Example: Adding User Profile Table

**Expansion**: Create new `user_profiles` table while keeping profile data in `users` table
```sql
-- New table creation (non-blocking)
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    bio TEXT,
    preferences JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Migration**: Application writes to both tables, reads from new table
**Contraction**: Remove profile columns from `users` table after verification

## Data Backfill Strategies

### Batch Processing Approach
- Process data in small, manageable chunks (1000-10000 rows)
- Implement checkpointing to resume from failures
- Use exponential backoff for transient errors
- Monitor system performance during backfill operations

### Online Backfill Techniques
- Background jobs that process data without blocking operations
- Rate limiting to prevent overwhelming database resources
- Progress tracking and monitoring dashboards
- Validation queries to ensure data consistency

### Parallel Processing
- Partition large tables by date ranges or ID ranges
- Use multiple worker processes for faster completion
- Coordinate workers to avoid conflicts and deadlocks
- Monitor resource usage across parallel operations

### Validation and Verification
- Compare row counts between source and target
- Sample-based validation for large datasets
- Checksum verification for critical data
- Automated rollback triggers for validation failures

---

## Feature Flag Integration

### Schema Version Gating
- Use feature flags to control which schema version applications use
- Gradual rollout of new schema usage across application instances
- Ability to quickly switch back to old schema during issues
- Independent control of read and write operations

### Application Code Compatibility
```python
# Example feature flag usage in application code
if feature_flags.is_enabled('use_new_user_profile_table'):
    profile = get_user_profile_from_new_table(user_id)
else:
    profile = get_user_profile_from_users_table(user_id)
```

### Migration Coordination
- Feature flags control migration job execution
- Separate flags for different migration phases
- Automatic flag updates based on migration progress
- Integration with deployment pipelines

### Testing and Validation
- Canary releases with schema changes
- A/B testing of schema performance
- Monitoring alerts tied to feature flag states
- Automated rollback based on error thresholds

---

## Rollback Verification and Recovery

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Database connection error rate thresholds
- Query performance degradation alerts
- Data validation failure detection
- Application error rate increases

### Rollback Procedures
- Immediate feature flag toggles to revert to old schema
- Database transaction rollback for failed migrations
- Data restoration from backup for corruption scenarios
- Application deployment rollback coordination

### Verification Steps
- Automated testing of critical user flows after rollback
- Data integrity checks on reverted schemas
- Performance monitoring to ensure normal operations
- Customer-facing service validation

### Recovery Documentation
- Step-by-step rollback procedures for each migration type
- Emergency contact information and escalation paths
- Communication templates for incident response
- Post-rollback investigation and improvement processes

---

## Migration Testing Framework

### Development Environment Testing
- Automated migration testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Database state validation before and after migrations
- Performance impact assessment on test datasets
- Rollback procedure verification

### Production-Like Testing
- Staging environment with production data volumes
- Load testing during migration execution
- Monitoring system validation during schema changes
- End-to-end testing of application functionality

### Canary Deployments
- Limited scope deployments to subset of production instances
- Real user traffic validation with new schema
- Gradual expansion based on success metrics
- Quick rollback capability during canary phase
