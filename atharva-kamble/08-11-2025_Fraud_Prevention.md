## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1. **Multi-Layer Fraud Detection**
- **Pre-Transaction Checks:** Validate card with Stripe Radar before trip start.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Flag accounts with abnormal ride frequency or unusual patterns.
- **Geo-Fencing:** Ensure pickup and drop-off points are within valid service zones.

### 2. **Stripe Radar & Rules**
- **Machine Learning Rules:** Automatic scoring of payment risk.
- **Custom Rules:**
  - Block cards with repeated declines in the past 24 hrs.
  - Block payments from flagged device fingerprints.
  - Require 3D Secure for high-risk transactions.

## 🔐 Security Protocols

### **1. Identity Verification**
- **Drivers:** Government-issued ID + selfie verification during onboarding.
- **Riders:** Email + phone verification, optional ID for high-value trips.

### **2. Device Fingerprinting**
- Store hashed device identifiers to detect multiple accounts from same device.

### **3. Location Consistency Checks**
- Validate that GPS coordinates during trip match declared pickup/drop-off.
