# 💳 Payment Processing & Settlement in Bimride (Stripe Integration)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a secure, scalable, and automated payment processing system in Bimride that handles rider fare collection, driver payouts, and platform commission using **Stripe's Connect** and **Payment Intents API**.

---

## 🔍 Why This Matters
- **Reliable payouts** ensure driver satisfaction and retention.
- **Seamless payments** improve rider experience.
- **Automated settlement** reduces operational overhead.
- **Global compliance** with PCI-DSS standards.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1. **Fare Calculation**
- Fare determined at trip completion:
```
final_fare = base_fare + (distance_km * per_km_rate) + (time_min * per_min_rate) + surge_fee
```
- Calculation handled by **Payment Service** in backend.
- Fare breakdown sent to both rider and driver apps.

### 2. **Payment Workflow**
1. **Trip Completion Event** triggers `createPaymentIntent` via Stripe API.
2. Rider's saved payment method (Card, Apple Pay, Google Pay) is charged.
3. Funds held in **Bimride Stripe account** until settlement.
4. Platform commission retained, driver's share transferred to **driver's Stripe connected account**.

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance
- **PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance** handled by Stripe — no card data stored on Bimride servers.
- All API calls to Stripe signed with server-side secret keys.
- Webhook verification to prevent spoofed payment events.

## ⚙️ Stripe Integration Details

### **1. Account Setup**
- **Platform account:** Registered Stripe account for Bimride.
- **Connected accounts:** One per driver using **Express** or **Standard** accounts.

### **2. Payment Intent Creation**
```javascript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: fareAmountInCents,
  currency: 'usd',
  customer: riderStripeId,
  payment_method: riderDefaultPaymentMethodId,
  off_session: true,
  confirm: true,
  transfer_data: {
    destination: driverStripeAccountId,
    amount: driverShareInCents
  },
  metadata: {
    trip_id: tripId,
    rider_id: riderId,
    driver_id: driverId
  }
});
```

### **3. Payout Scheduling**
- **Default:** Daily payouts to drivers via Stripe Connect.
- Configurable for weekly or instant payouts.
- Handles failed payout retries automatically.

### **4. Webhooks**
- `payment_intent.succeeded` → Mark trip as paid, trigger payout schedule.
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` → Notify rider, retry payment.
- `payout.failed` → Notify driver, reattempt payout.
