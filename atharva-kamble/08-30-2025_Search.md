# Address Search and Autocomplete Ranking

**Label:** ADDRESS_SEARCH_AND_AUTOCOMPLETE_RANKING  
**Purpose:** Query parsing, typo tolerance, ranking signals, click feedback loops, caching, fallback to external providers.

## Overview

Address search is fundamental to BimRide's user experience - riders need to find pickup and destination locations quickly and accurately. Poor address search leads to wrong locations, frustrated users, and failed ride matches. A robust search system combines multiple data sources, handles typos gracefully, and learns from user behavior to improve results continuously.

## Challenges Faced by BimRide

### Search Quality Issues
- **Ambiguous queries** like "downtown" or "mall" return too many irrelevant results
- **Typos and misspellings** in user input prevent finding correct addresses
- **Local context missing** - "Central Park" could refer to many different locations
- **POI coverage gaps** for new businesses, restaurants, and landmarks

### Performance Requirements
- **Sub-200ms response time** needed for real-time autocomplete
- **High query volume** during peak hours strains search infrastructure
- **Mobile connectivity issues** require offline search capabilities
- **Global scaling** across different languages and address formats

### Data Management
- **Multiple data sources** (Google Places, local government, user-generated) need integration
- **Stale data** for businesses that have closed or moved
- **Inconsistent formats** across different regions and countries
- **Privacy concerns** around storing and using location search history

## Query Parsing and Understanding

### Input Normalization
- Remove extra whitespace and special characters
- Convert to consistent case formatting
- Handle common abbreviations (St → Street, Ave → Avenue)
- Standardize directional indicators (N, North, etc.)

### Query Type Detection
- **Full addresses**: "123 Main Street, Bridgetown"
- **Partial addresses**: "Main Street" or "Downtown area"
- **POI names**: "Barbados Museum" or "Kensington Oval"
- **Landmarks**: "Airport" or "Bus Terminal"
- **Coordinates**: Direct lat/lng input from map interactions

### Geographic Context
- Use user's current location to bias search results
- Consider recent trip history for personalized suggestions
- Apply city/region filters based on service area
- Weight results based on popularity in local area

## Typo Tolerance and Fuzzy Matching

### Edit Distance Algorithms
- Levenshtein distance for single character errors
- Soundex for phonetic matching (especially useful for Caribbean place names)
- N-gram analysis for partial word matching
- Keyboard layout awareness for common typing mistakes

### Common Error Patterns
- **Transposed characters**: "steet" → "street"
- **Missing characters**: "bridgtown" → "bridgetown"
- **Extra characters**: "streeet" → "street"
- **Phonetic errors**: "sentral" → "central"

### Correction Strategies
- Suggest corrections with "Did you mean..." prompts
- Automatically apply high-confidence corrections
- Learn from user acceptance of suggestions
- Maintain dictionary of local-specific corrections

## Ranking Signals and Relevance

### Primary Ranking Factors

**Textual Relevance**
- Exact phrase matches get highest priority
- Prefix matching for autocomplete suggestions
- Stemming and synonyms for broader coverage
- Field-specific boosting (name vs description)

**Geographic Relevance**
- Distance from user's current location
- Proximity to recent pickup/destination locations
- Bias towards areas within BimRide service zones
- Population density as relevance factor

**Popularity Signals**
- Frequency of selection by BimRide users
- General search volume and click-through rates
- Business rating and review scores
- Social media mentions and trending topics

**Freshness Indicators**
- Recently added or updated business listings
- Temporal relevance for events and seasonal locations
- Data source recency and verification status
- User-generated content timestamps

### Business Logic Ranking
- Prioritize locations where BimRide operates
- Boost airports, hotels, and transportation hubs
- Favor addresses with successful ride completions
- Downrank locations with frequent cancellations

---

## Click Feedback Loops

### Data Collection
- Track user selections from autocomplete suggestions
- Record search queries that led to ride bookings
- Monitor locations where users frequently cancel
- Analyze time spent selecting from suggestions

### Feedback Integration
- Weight ranking algorithms based on selection patterns
- Identify and boost underperforming but relevant results
- Detect and demote spam or irrelevant locations
- Personalize results based on individual user behavior

### Learning Systems
- Machine learning models trained on historical click data
- A/B testing for ranking algorithm improvements
- Real-time adjustment of result ordering
- Collaborative filtering for similar user preferences

### Quality Assurance
- Human review of top search results
- Automated detection of ranking anomalies
- User feedback collection for result quality
- Regular audit of click-through patterns

## Caching Strategy

### Multi-Layer Caching

**Browser Cache (L1)**
- Store recent search results in mobile app
- Autocomplete suggestions for offline mode
- Location details for frequently visited places
- TTL: 1 hour for dynamic content, 24 hours for static

**CDN Cache (L2)**
- Popular search queries cached at edge locations
- Geographic distribution for reduced latency
- Cache warming for predictable search patterns
- TTL: 6 hours with smart invalidation

**Application Cache (L3)**
- Redis cluster for frequently accessed data
- Pre-computed results for common queries
- Session-based personalization cache
- TTL: 2 hours with background refresh

**Database Cache (L4)**
- Query result caching in database layer
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
- Index optimization for search patterns
- Background updates to maintain freshness

### Cache Invalidation
- Event-driven updates when business data changes
- Scheduled cache warming during low-traffic periods
- Intelligent cache partitioning by geography
- Monitoring cache hit rates and performance impact

## External Provider Integration

### Primary Data Sources
- **Google Places API**: Comprehensive global coverage
- **Local Government**: Official address databases
- **OpenStreetMap**: Community-maintained geographic data
- **Business Directories**: Yellow pages and industry-specific listings

### Fallback Strategy
- Primary search against internal index
- Secondary search against Google Places for gaps
- Tertiary search against other external providers
- User feedback collection for continuous improvement

### Data Enrichment
- Reverse geocoding for coordinate-based searches
- Business hours and contact information
- Photos and reviews for enhanced listings
- Category classification and tagging

### API Management
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Cost optimization through intelligent caching
- Circuit breakers for provider outages
- Performance monitoring and SLA tracking
