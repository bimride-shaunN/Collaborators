# BimRide Account And Profile Management Guide

Purpose: Help the team handle account access, profile updates, identity checks, and privacy requests with clear steps and simple language.

## What the profile page shows
The profile page in the admin panel is your starting place for account help. You will see contact info, verified devices, payment methods, wallet balance, recent trips, and any security holds. Use the timeline on that page to understand what changed and when.

## Identity and account verification
Always confirm that you are talking to the correct person before you share details or make changes.

* Ask for the phone number or email on the account  
* Send a one time code and ask the customer to read it back  
* If the customer cannot receive codes, verify with recent trip facts such as pickup street and last four digits of the card on file  
* Add a short note that explains how you verified identity

## Login help checklist
A customer says they cannot sign in.

* Confirm that the app is the current version  
* Ask the customer to request a fresh code and to keep the app in the foreground  
* Confirm that the phone can receive calls or texts  
* If codes do not arrive, try email based sign in if the account has an email  
* If the device was changed, clear old sessions from the profile page  
* If the account shows a security hold, explain the hold and the next step  
* When sign in succeeds, confirm the contact method that works best

Sample reply  
I sent a new code. Keep the app open and enter the code when it arrives. If you still do not receive it we can try email sign in or we can clear old sessions so your new device can start fresh.

## Change of phone number or email
Customers often update contact details after a number change or a new email. Use the profile page to edit these fields.

* Confirm identity with a code to the current contact method  
* Add the new phone or email in the profile page  
* Send a verification to the new contact method  
* Ask the customer to confirm that messages arrive correctly  
* Remove any contact method that the customer no longer owns

If the customer lost access to the old number and cannot receive a code, use trip facts and card last four digits to verify identity, then update the number and send a new code to the new contact method.

## Duplicate accounts
Some customers create a second account by mistake.

* Search by phone and email to find both accounts  
* Confirm which account the customer wants to keep  
* Move valid payment methods to the kept account if the tools allow it  
* Close the extra account with a short note that explains the reason  
* Ask the customer to sign out and sign in with the kept account

## Account security holds and reactivation
A hold can appear for several reasons such as repeated failed payments or reports of unusual activity.

* Explain the hold in simple terms  
* Ask for any documents that the policy requires such as a clear profile photo or a copy of the card used  
* If a payment method failed, ask the customer to check with the bank and then try again  
* When all checks pass, remove the hold and confirm sign in on a fresh session  
* Note the reason for the hold and the steps taken before reactivation

## Payment methods on file
Customers can add or remove cards in the app. Support can view and sometimes remove cards that are not in use.

* Never ask for full card numbers  
* You may confirm brand and last four digits  
* If a card cannot be removed because it is tied to a pending charge, explain that removal is possible after the charge settles

## Data privacy requests
BimRide supports data export and account deletion upon request.

* For data export, confirm identity and open a privacy request from the profile page  
* Explain that export delivery can take time and that a link will be sent when ready  
* For deletion, confirm identity, explain that deletion is permanent, and follow the deletion request flow  
* If there is a pending charge or dispute, the request may pause until required records are settled  
* Record consent and the request reference in the ticket

Sample reply  
I have started your data export. You will receive a link at your email to download a copy when it is ready. If you prefer full deletion, reply to confirm and I will start that process next.

## Profile corrections
Sometimes names or photos need updates.

* Names can be edited when they are simple spelling fixes  
* Photos must meet clarity and safety guidelines  
* If a driver profile photo does not meet rules, ask for a new upload through the app and explain the requirement in clear terms

## Script library
Contact update  
I updated your contact method and sent a confirmation. Please open the message and confirm so we know it is working.

Duplicate account  
I found two accounts. We will keep the account that uses this phone number and close the extra account. Please sign out and sign in again so the app uses the correct profile.

Security hold  
Your account is on hold for safety checks. I will guide you through the steps to clear it. Once we finish these checks you can sign in and ride again.

## Checklist before you close
* Identity is verified and recorded in notes  
* The change is applied in the panel and tested  
* The customer understands what to expect next  
* The ticket has a short summary that explains the fix

Outcome  
You can help customers sign in, update contact information, resolve duplicate profiles, clear holds when it is safe, and handle privacy requests with clear steps and simple messages.
