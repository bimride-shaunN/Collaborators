# Data Schema Governance and Data Quality

**Label:** DATA_SCHEMA_GOVERNANCE_AND_DATA_QUALITY  
**Purpose:** Event contracts, schema registry, versioning, late event handling, privacy tags and retention, quality checks.

---

## Overview

BimRide processes millions of events daily - ride requests, driver locations, payments, and user interactions. As the platform scales, maintaining consistent data contracts across services becomes critical for reliability, debugging, and analytics. Schema governance ensures data quality while enabling safe evolution of event structures.

## Challenges Faced by BimRide

### Data Inconsistency Issues
- **Schema drift** between producer and consumer services leads to parsing errors
- **Breaking changes** deployed without coordination cause downstream failures
- **Missing field validation** allows corrupt data to propagate through the system
- **Inconsistent naming conventions** across different engineering teams

### Event Processing Problems
- **Late-arriving events** from mobile apps during poor connectivity
- **Duplicate events** from retry mechanisms creating incorrect analytics
- **Out-of-order events** affecting real-time driver location updates
- **Schema version mismatches** between different service deployments

### Compliance and Privacy
- **Data retention requirements** vary by region and data type
- **Privacy regulations** require automatic data masking and deletion
- **Audit trails** needed for financial and safety-critical events
- **Cross-border data transfer** restrictions in different markets

## Event Contracts and Schema Registry

### Centralized Schema Management
- Single source of truth for all event schemas across BimRide
- Versioned schemas with backward and forward compatibility rules
- Automatic validation of schema changes before deployment
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for safe schema evolution

### Event Contract Examples
```json
{
  "event_type": "ride_requested",
  "version": "v2.1",
  "required_fields": ["rider_id", "pickup_location", "timestamp"],
  "optional_fields": ["destination", "ride_type", "promo_code"]
}
```

### Schema Evolution Patterns
- **Backward Compatible**: Adding optional fields, relaxing validation
- **Forward Compatible**: Consumers ignore unknown fields gracefully  
- **Breaking Changes**: Require explicit version bumps and migration plans
- **Deprecation Timeline**: Minimum 90-day notice before removing fields

---

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning for Schemas
- **Major version**: Breaking changes requiring consumer updates
- **Minor version**: Backward-compatible additions
- **Patch version**: Documentation or metadata changes only

### Version Management
- Multiple schema versions supported simultaneously
- Gradual migration plans for breaking changes
- Automatic compatibility checking between versions
- Producer-consumer version negotiation

### Migration Patterns
- **Expand-Contract**: Add new fields first, migrate consumers, then remove old fields
- **Dual Writing**: Producers write to both old and new schemas during transition
- **Shadow Reading**: Consumers validate new schema parsing before switching

---

## Late Event Handling

### Common Scenarios in BimRide
- **Mobile connectivity issues** cause delayed location updates
- **Payment processing delays** result in late transaction confirmations
- **Driver app crashes** lead to missing trip completion events
- **Network partitions** create event backlogs

### Handling Strategies
- **Event timestamping** with both producer and ingestion timestamps
- **Grace periods** for accepting late events (e.g., 5 minutes for locations)
- **Reprocessing workflows** for critical business events
- **Idempotency keys** to handle duplicate late events safely

### Business Impact Mitigation
- Real-time dashboards show delayed event metrics
- Automated alerts for events outside acceptable latency windows
- Manual override capabilities for critical operational decisions
- Historical data correction procedures for analytics accuracy

## Privacy Tags and Data Retention

### Data Classification System
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Names, phone numbers, emails
- **Sensitive**: Location data, payment information, driver earnings
- **Public**: Aggregated metrics, anonymized analytics data
- **Internal**: System logs, performance metrics

### Privacy Tag Implementation
```json
{
  "event_type": "trip_completed",
  "privacy_tags": {
    "rider_id": "PII",
    "pickup_location": "SENSITIVE", 
    "fare_amount": "SENSITIVE",
    "trip_duration": "PUBLIC"
  }
}
```

### Retention Policies
- **PII data**: 7 years for compliance, then automatic deletion
- **Location data**: 2 years for analytics, then anonymization
- **Payment data**: 10 years for financial regulations
- **System logs**: 90 days for debugging, then archival

### Privacy-Preserving Analytics
- Automatic data anonymization for research datasets
- Differential privacy for aggregate statistics
- Geographic data generalization (zip code level vs exact coordinates)
- Regular privacy impact assessments

## Data Quality Checks

### Real-Time Validation
- **Schema conformance** checking at event ingestion
- **Business rule validation** (e.g., trip distance vs duration sanity checks)
- **Range validation** for numeric fields (coordinates within service area)
- **Referential integrity** checks between related events

### Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: Percentage of required fields populated
- **Accuracy**: Validation against known good sources
- **Consistency**: Cross-field validation within events
- **Timeliness**: Event freshness and processing delays

### Quality Monitoring
- Real-time quality score dashboards per event type
- Automated alerts for quality degradation
- Data lineage tracking for root cause analysis
- Quality reports for downstream data consumers

### Remediation Workflows
- Automatic data correction for known issues
- Manual review queues for suspicious events
- Reprocessing pipelines for corrupted data batches
- Impact assessment tools for quality incidents
