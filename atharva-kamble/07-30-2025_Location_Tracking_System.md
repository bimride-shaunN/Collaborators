# 📍 Real-Time Location Tracking System – Day 1

## 🎯 Objective

To define the system architecture and technical requirements for a **real-time location tracking system** that powers core features in ride-hailing apps like **Bimride**. This includes tracking drivers and riders in motion, enabling accurate ETA calculations, and ensuring visibility throughout the ride lifecycle.

---

## 🚘 Why Real-Time Location Tracking Is Critical

In ride-hailing platforms such as Uber and Bimride, live tracking plays a vital role in:

- Showing where the driver is before and during pickup
- Displaying the moving car icon on the rider's screen
- Sharing real-time ETA updates
- Ensuring safety and accountability
- Supporting navigation, dynamic routing, and surge pricing

This system is one of the **most-used and most-trusted** features in the user journey.

## 🔍 System Requirements

### 🔁 Real-Time Sync

- **Frequency**: At least 1 update every 3–5 seconds
- **Latency**: < 300ms end-to-end
- **Consistency**: All parties see near-synchronized updates

### 📡 Mobile Location Precision

- GPS + WiFi + Cell Tower fusion
- Accuracy within 5–10 meters
- Background and foreground collection support

### ☁️ Backend Capacity

- Handle 100K+ concurrent location streams
- Stream updates to multiple consumers (rider, driver, support dashboard)
- Compress and store paths efficiently for analytics

### ⚖️ Efficiency Goals

- Minimize **battery consumption** on mobile
- Compress location data over network (WebSocket, MQTT)
- Geo-hash or throttle intelligently to reduce bandwidth

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **Location updates must be encrypted** in transit using **TLS**
- **Anonymized storage** of historical path data for analytics and safety
- **Access control**: Only authorized users (e.g., the assigned rider or driver) can view live or historical location
- **TTL (Time-to-Live)** for real-time visibility – access ends after the trip ends or after a defined timeout

## 🧠 Design Challenges

| Challenge                     | Strategy                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GPS noise in dense areas     | Use map matching, Kalman filters, and motion-based heuristics            |
| Low battery optimization     | Adjust polling frequency dynamically based on ride phase or movement     |
| Mobile network drops         | Implement buffering and use last known location fallback                 |
| Scaling WebSocket streams    | Use MQTT/Kafka and shard streams based on user or geo-hash               |
| Privacy during trip sharing  | Apply obfuscation, tokenized access, and temporary shareable links       |
