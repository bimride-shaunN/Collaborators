# 📊 Analytics & Demand Forecasting for Bimride

## 🎯 Objective
Build an analytics pipeline and forecasting model to predict demand, optimize driver allocation, and improve operational efficiency for the Bimride platform.

---

## 🔍 Why This Matters
- Minimizes rider wait times by positioning drivers before demand spikes.
- Improves driver earnings by reducing idle time.
- Helps the platform plan for events, seasonal changes, and peak periods.
- Provides insights for dynamic pricing, marketing campaigns, and expansion planning.

---

## 🏗️ Analytics Architecture

### 1. **Data Collection Layer**
- **Real-Time Data Sources:**
  - Rider app requests (timestamp, location, trip type).
  - Driver availability pings (location, status).
  - Trip completion events.
- **Batch Data Sources:**
  - Historical trip records from PostgreSQL.
  - Weather and event data from external APIs.
  - Marketing campaign performance data.

---

### 2. **Data Storage & Processing**
- **Streaming Layer:** Kafka or AWS Kinesis for real-time ingestion.
- **Storage:**
  - PostgreSQL for structured trip/event data.
  - S3/Google Cloud Storage for raw & historical logs.
- **Processing:**
  - Apache Spark or AWS Glue for ETL.
  - Aggregation jobs scheduled hourly/daily.

---

### 3. **Forecasting Engine**
- **Models Used:**
  - Time Series Models: ARIMA, Prophet for hourly demand prediction.
  - ML Models: XGBoost or LSTM for multi-feature forecasting (weather, events, seasonality).
- **Features Considered:**
  - Hour of day, day of week, month.
  - Weather conditions (rain, snow, heatwaves).
  - Event proximity (concerts, sports).
  - Historical surge patterns.

## 📡 Demand Prediction Workflow
1. Ingest real-time requests and driver location updates via Kafka.
2. Aggregate data by geo-zone and 5–15 min intervals.
3. Feed processed features into ML/time series models.
4. Output demand predictions for the next 30–60 minutes.
5. Surface recommendations to:
   - **Drivers:** Position in predicted high-demand areas.
   - **Dispatch System:** Prioritize matching in certain zones.
   - **Pricing Engine:** Adjust multipliers proactively.

---

## 🔐 Data Governance
- All analytics data anonymized before processing.
- Access restricted to authorized internal teams.
- Data retention policies:
  - Real-time data: 7–14 days in hot storage.
  - Historical data: Archived in cold storage for 1–3 years.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Extensions
- **Driver Incentive Programs:** Bonus payouts for pre-positioning in forecasted high-demand areas.
- **Marketing Triggers:** Launch targeted campaigns before expected demand dips.
- **Capacity Planning:** Align driver onboarding with seasonal trends.
