# BimRide Wallets Payments And Refunds Guide

Purpose: Explain how money flows in BimRide, how to read what you see in the panel, and how to fix common money related issues.

## Key ideas in simple terms
* A hold reserves funds when a ride starts  
* A charge is the final amount when the ride ends  
* A refund sends money back after a charge  
* The wallet is a balance inside BimRide for future rides

## Where to look first
* Rider profile shows current wallet balance and recent actions  
* Trip page shows estimate, final amount, and receipt status  
* Payments tab shows holds, charges, and refunds for the user

## Holds and charges
It is normal for a rider to see a hold and a charge at the same time for a short period. The bank clears the hold on its own. If the rider asks, explain that the hold will drop away and the charge is the real amount.

Sample reply  
Your bank placed a temporary hold when the ride began. The final charge posted after dropoff. The temporary amount will clear on the bank side. Timing depends on the bank.

## Wallet basics
The wallet shows credits and debits. Credits add money. Debits remove money. If a wallet balance does not match the recent list of entries, note the ticket and ask finance to review. Do not guess new numbers.

## When a refund is right
* Clear billing error on the final amount  
* Duplicate charge for the same ride  
* A promised coupon did not apply and the rider was eligible

## How to issue a refund or credit
* Open the trip or payment record  
* Choose refund and enter the amount  
* Write a short reason in plain words  
* Send a short note to the rider that confirms the amount and expected timing

## Common questions and short answers
**Why do I see two amounts on my bank app**  
One is a hold and one is the final charge. The hold will clear on its own.

**Can you speed up my bank**  
We cannot change bank timing. If a hold remains after several days the rider can call the bank.

**I used a coupon but it did not work**  
If the rider was eligible you can add a credit equal to the coupon value.

## Simple checks for accuracy
* The receipt email was sent  
* The name on the account matches who called in  
* The amount of any credit matches the written promise  
* The reason is in the ticket and in the panel note

Outcome  
You can read wallet and payment screens with confidence, explain holds and charges in plain language, and issue fair refunds or credits with a clean record.
