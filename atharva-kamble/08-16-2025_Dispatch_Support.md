# BimRide Live Rides Dispatch And Trip Help

Purpose: Help you support riders and drivers while a ride is active or just finished. Keep people calm, keep data correct, and keep notes clear.

## What happens during a normal ride
* Rider requests a car and sees an estimate  
* A nearby driver accepts the request  
* The app shows driver arrival time  
* The trip starts at pickup and ends at dropoff  
* The final amount is calculated and the receipt is sent

## How to check live status
* Open the trip page and look at current state  
* Confirm driver location and arrival time  
* Share a simple update with the rider if needed

## When pickup is slow
Steps you can try  
* Ask the rider to check the pickup pin and nearby street name  
* Suggest a nearby corner if the street is blocked  
* If the driver is far away offer a cancel and rematch if policy allows

Sample reply  
I can see your driver on the way. If the street is blocked please move one block to the corner by the cafe. I will let the driver know.

## When a trip looks stuck
A ride that stays in progress for a long time can be stuck.  
* Call the driver through the masked number and ask if dropoff happened  
* If both sides confirm dropoff, end the trip in the panel and send the receipt  
* If there is a disagreement, pause and escalate to a lead with notes

## Reassigning a driver
Use this when the driver cannot reach pickup or has a safety flag.  
* Cancel the match with the correct reason  
* Send the request to the next driver  
* Tell the rider the new arrival time

## Cancellations and fees
Fees depend on the timing and state of the ride.  
* Waive the fee if the app showed a blocked street or if the driver did not move toward the rider  
* Keep the fee if the rider did not show after the agreed wait time

## Lost and found
* Confirm the trip and item description  
* Ask permission to connect rider and driver  
* Propose a time and place to meet  
* Note the result in the ticket

## Accessibility and special care
* Service animals are always allowed  
* Offer extra time at pickup if requested  
* Suggest a larger car if a stroller or heavy luggage is present

Outcome  
You can follow a live ride, give simple guidance at pickup, finish a stuck trip when both sides agree, and leave a clear record that explains what you did.
