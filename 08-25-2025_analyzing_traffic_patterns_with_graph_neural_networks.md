## üöÄ Introduction

This file documents **Analyzing Traffic Patterns with Graph Neural Networks** as part of Bimride‚Äôs progress in Barbados. 
It highlights algorithms, CI/CD pipelines, and local context (e.g. Bathsheba (St. Joseph)). 
The goal is to show clear proof-of-work for nonprofit auditing and long-term background checks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Data sources: ride logs, external APIs, and survey data.
- Security: API keys stored in Key Vault; TLS everywhere.
- Processing: mix of batch ETL and low-latency inference.
- Monitoring: domain KPIs logged to Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana.
- Scalability: containerized services deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service.
