## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Monitoring: domain KPIs logged to Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana.
- Security: API keys stored in Key Vault; TLS everywhere.
- Data sources: ride logs, external APIs, and survey data.
- Processing: mix of batch ETL and low-latency inference.
- Scalability: containerized services deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service.

## üß† Algorithms Used

```python
import requests
def fetch_weather(parish):
    resp = requests.get("https://api.weather.example/"+parish)
    return resp.json()['temp_c']
```
