---

## üìå Overview
This week‚Äôs focus was on designing and refining a **dummy pitch deck project** for **Bimride**, with the objective of learning how to structure and communicate a compelling story to potential investors.  
The dummy project simulates the process of creating an actual deck that can later be adapted for real VC presentations and pitch competitions.  

The work involved:  
1. Researching **pitch deck best practices** from successful startups (Uber, Lyft, Airbnb).  
2. Structuring the **content flow** to balance storytelling with data.  
3. Designing **slides step by step** as a dummy project.  
4. Identifying **challenges** while building clarity and investor appeal.  
5. Mapping how this pitch deck can directly help Bimride attract investors and prepare for scaling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dummy Project Work (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Research & Framework Selection
- Studied successful pitch decks and noted the **10 core slides** investors expect:  
  1. Introduction & Vision  
  2. Problem  
  3. Solution  
  4. Market Opportunity  
  5. Product Demo / App Overview  
  6. Business Model  
  7. Traction  
  8. Competitive Landscape  
  9. Financial Projections  
  10. Team & Roadmap  

- Selected **Guy Kawasaki‚Äôs 10/20/30 Rule** (10 slides, 20 min pitch, 30 pt font) as a guiding principle.

### Step 2: Crafting the Storyline
- Defined **Bimride‚Äôs vision**: "To transform urban mobility in Barbados and the Caribbean with safe, affordable, and tech-driven ride-hailing."  
- Framed the **problem statement**: Limited public transport reliability, high taxi fares, and lack of trust/safety mechanisms.  
- Highlighted the **solution**: A localized ride-hailing platform tailored to Caribbean users, with **blockchain verification** for drivers, **crypto-friendly payments**, and **business intelligence dashboards** for efficiency.

### Step 3: Building Each Slide (Dummy Deck)
- **Introduction:** Bimride‚Äôs mission & tagline.  
- **Problem:** Visual storytelling ‚Äì unreliable transport, high costs, safety issues.  
- **Solution:** Bimride‚Äôs unique features (AI-based dispatch, blockchain verification, BI integration).  
- **Market:** Ride-hailing market in the Caribbean valued at $X million, with growth potential (dummy numbers for now).  
- **Product Demo:** Mockup screens of Bimride app showing booking, driver verification, and payment.  
- **Business Model:** 20% commission per ride + premium corporate accounts.  
- **Traction (Dummy):** 5,000 rides in pilot (fictional data to simulate).  
- **Competition:** Uber, Lyft (global), vs Bimride (localized).  
- **Financials (Dummy):** Projected revenue of $1M in 2 years with 20% MoM growth.  
- **Team & Roadmap:** Highlighted a dummy leadership team and milestones (Seed ‚Üí Series A ‚Üí Expansion).  

---

### Step 4: Visual & Design
- Used **Canva & Google Slides** for layout and icons.  
- Chose **minimalistic design** with Bimride‚Äôs brand colors (blue + green).  
- Added simple infographics for market sizing and revenue streams.  

---

### Step 5: Pitch Practice Simulation
- Created a **dummy script** (3 minutes per slide).  
- Practiced answering **VC-style questions**:  
  - "Why Barbados first?"  
  - "How will you scale across the Caribbean?"  
  - "How do you ensure profitability?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
1. **Market Sizing:** Limited data for the Caribbean ride-hailing market ‚Üí had to use proxies from LATAM & global mobility reports.  
2. **Traction Metrics:** Since this is a dummy project, I struggled to simulate realistic user growth and retention figures.  
3. **Design Balance:** Keeping slides visually engaging but not overcrowded.  
4. **Investor Expectations:** Crafting a deck that appeals to both **impact investors** (social benefits in Barbados) and **VCs** (scalability & returns).  
5. **Storytelling vs Data:** Finding the right balance between emotional storytelling (local need) and hard financials.

- **Trust Building:** Smart contracts & blockchain driver verification can be showcased as **Bimride‚Äôs differentiator**.  
- **BI Integration:** Highlighting data dashboards for investors demonstrates **transparency & operational efficiency**.
