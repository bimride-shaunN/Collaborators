## Project Objective

- Prototype a chatbot capable of assisting riders and drivers with FAQs and trip-related support.  
- Create a workflow that can be implemented in a real ride-hailing application.  
- Explore how BI and PM integration can help track, analyze, and improve the chatbot’s effectiveness.

## Work Completed (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Research & Planning
- Studied common rider and driver support scenarios:
  - Rider issues: trip delays, cancellations, payment issues, lost items.  
  - Driver issues: trip assignments, vehicle updates, earnings queries, ratings.  
- Reviewed AI chatbot solutions in the ride-hailing sector to identify best practices.  
- Created a preliminary workflow diagram to map out conversation paths.  

### 2. Conversation Flow Design
- Developed multi-step conversation flows for rider and driver FAQs:  
  - Rider examples:  
    - “Where is my driver?” → Provide ETA and driver info.  
    - “How do I cancel a trip?” → Provide cancellation steps.  
    - “I lost an item in the car” → Guide to support contact.  
  - Driver examples:  
    - “How do I update vehicle info?” → Step-by-step guidance.  
    - “How can I check earnings?” → Show earnings dashboard path.  
- Designed fallback paths for unrecognized queries to ensure user satisfaction.  
- Drafted response templates with a professional yet friendly tone.  

### 3. Prototyping the Chatbot
- Built a functional dummy chatbot interface using a prototyping tool.  
- Simulated user queries and chatbot responses for testing:  
  - Handled both single-step FAQs and multi-step support queries.  
- Tested conversation flow to ensure logical paths and context retention.  
- Added polite fallback messages for unhandled scenarios.  

### 4. BI (Business Intelligence) Integration Planning
- Designed BI metrics to track chatbot interactions:  
  - Total number of queries by type (rider vs. driver).  
  - Frequency of unresolved or escalated queries.  
  - Regional distribution of issues and support requests.  
- Created mock BI dashboards to visualize metrics:  
  - Top FAQs by frequency.  
  - Average query resolution time.  
  - Trends and patterns in user issues over time.  
- Planned BI usage to identify pain points and improve chatbot performance.  

### 5. PM (Product Management) Integration Planning
- Developed an iterative PM workflow for chatbot improvement:  
  1. Collect queries via chatbot logs.  
  2. Analyze recurring issues to prioritize feature backlog.  
  3. Update conversation flows and response templates.  
  4. Test updated chatbot features and measure KPIs.  
- Defined KPIs for chatbot performance:  
  - Query resolution rate.  
  - Chatbot adoption rate.  
  - User satisfaction score.  

### 6. Testing and Optimization
- Conducted mock testing with a variety of user queries.  
- Logged simulated data to track chatbot performance metrics.  
- Optimized conversation flows based on testing results.  
- Ensured chatbot maintained context in multi-step interactions.  

---

## Challenges Faced

- Identifying all possible user support scenarios for riders and drivers.  
- Designing conversation flows that are both comprehensive and easy to navigate.  
- Handling multi-step queries that require maintaining context.  
- Translating logged data into actionable BI insights.  
- Anticipating PM iteration priorities to improve chatbot features efficiently.

## BI and PM Integration Potential for Bimride

**BI Integration:**  
- Track chatbot interactions to identify recurring user issues.  
- Visualize performance metrics using dashboards to monitor unresolved queries and support trends.  
- Use BI insights to make data-driven decisions on feature improvements.  

**PM Integration:**  
- Implement agile iterations to continuously enhance chatbot responses and features.  
- Prioritize updates based on BI insights and user feedback.  
- Measure KPIs to ensure improvements are effective and impactful.

## Key Takeaways

- AI-powered chatbots can significantly reduce repetitive support workload while improving response times.  
- Context-aware conversation flows are critical for user satisfaction.  
- BI dashboards provide actionable insights for support optimization and feature planning.  
- PM integration ensures continuous improvement through structured feature iteration.  
- Prototyping a dummy chatbot workflow lays the foundation for full-scale implementation.

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Convert the prototype into a functional chatbot integrated within the Bimride app.  
2. Implement BI tracking for all chatbot interactions to monitor performance.  
3. Establish PM sprint cycles to iteratively improve the chatbot.  
4. Collect real user feedback to refine AI responses and handle edge cases.  
5. Incorporate escalation pathways for human support when needed.
