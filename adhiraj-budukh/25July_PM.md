# Detailed Report – 25 July

## Overview

Today’s work centered around studying and prototyping how **product management (PM) frameworks** and **business intelligence (BI) standards** can be integrated into Bimride, a Barbados-based ride-hailing platform.  

The dummy project focused on designing workflows for **tracking product KPIs**, **measuring performance**, and **implementing BI dashboards**. These are critical for scaling ride-hailing services because they provide insights into rider/driver behavior, operational efficiency, and long-term growth strategies.

This report summarizes today’s activities, challenges faced, and how the findings can be applied to the actual Bimride platform.

## Work Done

### 1. Research on Product Management (PM) Standards

- Explored **PM methodologies** relevant for ride-hailing applications:
  - **Agile & Scrum:** Iterative updates for app features (driver onboarding, payment integration, ride-matching).
  - **Lean Product Management:** Rapid experimentation with features (e.g., crypto payments, loyalty programs).
  - **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):** Framework for aligning teams toward measurable goals.

- Identified **core PM needs for Bimride**:
  - Monitor **driver acquisition** and **retention rates**.
  - Track **average wait time** for rides.
  - Improve **payment method adoption** (cashless, crypto).
  - Ensure **regulatory compliance** for operations in Barbados.

### 2. Research on Business Intelligence (BI) Standards

- Studied how **BI standards** can be applied to ride-hailing:
  - **Data Warehousing Standards:** Central repository for trip data, driver records, and payments.
  - **ETL Pipelines:** Extract, transform, and load data from mobile app → BI warehouse.
  - **Visualization Dashboards:** Tools like Power BI, Tableau, or open-source Metabase.
  - **Data Governance:** Compliance with data privacy and accuracy regulations.

- Key **BI Metrics Identified** for Bimride:
  - **Operational Metrics:** Number of rides per day, cancellation rates, surge-pricing impact.
  - **Financial Metrics:** Revenue per ride, driver payouts, average transaction value.
  - **User Metrics:** Rider retention, churn rate, customer satisfaction (CSAT).
  - **Safety Metrics:** Verified driver IDs (linked with blockchain from earlier projects).

### 3. Dummy Project: Designing a BI-Driven PM Workflow

I created a small prototype workflow simulating **how product management and BI standards can work together**:

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Dummy trip data generated (ride start time, end time, fare, driver ID).  
   - Dummy driver onboarding dataset (with verification status).  

2. **Data Pipeline:**  
   - Used Python (simulated) to transform raw ride data into summarized metrics.  
   - ETL pipeline mockup: mobile app → data warehouse → dashboard.  

3. **Visualization:**  
   - Built a dummy dashboard concept in Excel/Google Sheets (stand-in for BI tools).  
   - Showed KPIs like:
     - Average ride wait time  
     - Daily active riders/drivers  
     - Revenue trend per week  
     - Driver verification completion rate  

4. **PM Integration:**  
   - Linked KPIs to **OKRs**:
     - Objective: Improve rider experience  
       - Key Result: Reduce wait time from 8 mins → 5 mins in 3 months  
     - Objective: Increase driver trust  
       - Key Result: 95% driver verification via blockchain system

### 4. Exploring Integration for Bimride

- **PM Tools Integration:** Jira/Asana can be used to track feature development aligned with BI insights.  
- **BI Tools Integration:** Dashboards can be embedded in admin portals to allow real-time monitoring.  
- **Decision Loops:** BI insights → PM prioritization → Engineering tasks → Product updates.  

This loop ensures **data-driven decision-making** for Bimride’s growth.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Data Availability**  
   - As a dummy project, I had to generate synthetic data since real trip datasets weren’t available.  
   - Challenge: Simulating realistic data distributions (rush hours, peak demand, cancellations).

2. **Tool Overlap Between PM and BI**  
   - PM tools like Jira also support reporting, while BI tools specialize in deeper analytics.  
   - Challenge: Finding the balance between product roadmapping and analytical depth.

3. **Scalability Concerns**  
   - Dummy project worked fine with small datasets.  
   - Real ride-hailing systems generate **millions of records** daily, requiring scalable ETL and storage.

4. **Compliance with Privacy Laws**  
   - Barbados (and global) regulations require anonymizing rider data.  
   - Challenge: Ensuring data remains **useful for BI** while also being **privacy-compliant**.

5. **Cross-Team Alignment**  
   - PM teams focus on product features, while BI teams focus on insights.  
   - Challenge: Defining a process where both sides work together seamlessly.

## Application in Bimride Ride-Hailing Service

### Benefits of Integration

- **Smarter Product Decisions:**  
  Instead of guessing which feature to build, decisions are guided by BI insights (e.g., drivers cancel trips due to low fare rates → PM can design incentive programs).

- **Optimized Operations:**  
  BI dashboards allow real-time monitoring of driver supply vs rider demand, helping reduce wait times.

- **Enhanced Trust & Safety:**  
  BI systems can track driver onboarding verification rates and identify anomalies (e.g., unverified drivers still active).  
  When combined with blockchain-based identity storage (from 24 July work), this adds transparency.

- **Revenue Growth:**  
  Product teams can experiment with loyalty programs, crypto payments, or surge pricing, while BI measures success.

- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  BI ensures reporting standards are met, giving regulators confidence in Bimride’s operations.

### Example Scenario for Bimride

- **Problem:** Riders complain about long wait times during peak hours.  
- **BI Insight:** Dashboard shows demand outstrips supply between 6–8 PM in Bridgetown.  
- **PM Action:** Product team launches a new **driver incentive program** during peak hours.  
- **Follow-Up:** BI tracks whether average wait time improves.  

This creates a **closed feedback loop** of continuous improvement.

## Conclusion

Today’s dummy project demonstrated how **product management frameworks** and **BI standards** can be combined to build a **data-driven ride-hailing ecosystem**.  

For Bimride, the integration would mean:  
- Better decision-making  
- Enhanced customer trust and safety  
- Scalable operations  
- Improved compliance and transparency  

The **next step** would be to implement a **pilot BI dashboard** connected to live Bimride trip data, gradually expanding toward a full PM-BI integrated system.
